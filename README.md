## üìñ About The Project

This project is a full-stack web application built with a Python FastAPI backend and a vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend. It serves as an educational tool to demonstrate the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) in processing natural language to provide structured, informational responses. User queries and AI responses are logged in an SQLite database.

**This application is for informational and educational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.**
